NodeBasedSyncing Rust

A simple node based syncing application built in rust , which will later be reimplemented in golang

NodeBasedSyncingGo[https://github.com/Inalegwu/NodeBasedSyncingGo]

this is a series of projects done out of pure boredom , trying to implement some basic distributed systems concepts
without referencing any major distributed systems documents , just to see how far I can go off of my own knowledge

NOTE : These 2 Projects are being done simultaneously , to help me practice context switching (Since I'm a major masochist :_) )
